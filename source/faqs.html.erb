                Q: What faith communities currently support CAJM?
            </h2> 
            <h2>
                A: CAJM is currently supported by clergy and laity from more than a dozen faith communities, including: African Methodist Episcopal (AME), Baptist, Congregational, Anglican, Episcopalian, Greek Orthodox, Lutheran, Orthodox Union of Judaism, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Union of Reform Judaism, Unitarian, and United Methodist.

                Q: What Happened at the CAJM Community Problems Assembly on November 16, 2015?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                A: On Monday, November 16, 2015 CAJM congregations packed the house (Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church) for the CAJM Community Problems Assembly. 
            </h2>
             
            <p> 
                With 617 people in attendance, CAJM had 552 voting Network Members, the voting went as follows: Racial Discrimination, with 349 votes (63% of all votes), will be the problem area that we focus on this justice cycle. Public Transportation received 135 votes and Affordable Housing received 68 votes. It was put to the gathered body, and unanimously passed, that we would also continue to work on juvenile incarceration by focusing on school-based arrests. Thank you to everyone who made their voices heard by being a part of the Community Problems Assembly!
            </p>
            <p>
                Another very exciting part of the evening was that we welcomed three new member congregations/organizations! The YWCA of Charleston, St. Francis Episcopal, and Bethel Presbyterian have all joined our ranks and that growth is wonderful to see. Those in attendance also voted to install new CAJM Board Members whose terms begin January 1, 2016.

            <h2>
                On Monday night 12/7/2015 at St. James Presbyterian over 150 people attended the Research Kick-off! 
            </h2>

            <p>
                They came out ready to engage in great research over these next couple of months! Racial Discrimination was the issue voted as the subject for the Nehemiah Action scheduled for April 18, 2016.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Those people that attended had an opportunity to sign up for the committee on which they wanted to serve. The active committee options were: Racial Discrimination, School Based Arrests, PBIS & Restorative Justice, and the Hiring Policy. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Research visits have started.

                There was so much energy and excitement as we heard reports from the house meetings about the very serious community problems raised. After sharing, the voting was narrowed down into several broad categories: Affordable Housing, Gun Violence, Racial Discrimination, Domestic Violence, Substance Abuse and Addiction, Mental Health, Public Transportation, Health Care, Criminal Justice System and Education. One hundred Team Leaders voted on behalf of their house meetings and Network Members and the voting results were as follows:

            <div class="item-descr">
                CAJM began in 2011 when a group of clergy gathered together to form a Sponsoring Committee with the Director of DART to begin the process of establishing a justice organization in the Charleston area. In October of 2012, member congregations came together and voted to address the following issues: Schools/Education and Crime/Violence. CAJM's research committees worked tirelessly to identify the specific issues for CAJM to address.
