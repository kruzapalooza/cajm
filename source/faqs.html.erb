                Q: What Happened at the CAJM Community Problems Assembly on November 16, 2015?
            </h2>

            <h2>
                A: On Monday, November 16, 2015 CAJM congregations packed the house (Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church) for the CAJM Community Problems Assembly. 
            </h2>
             
            <p> 
                With 617 people in attendance, CAJM had 552 voting Network Members, the voting went as follows: Racial Discrimination, with 349 votes (63% of all votes), will be the problem area that we focus on this justice cycle. Public Transportation received 135 votes and Affordable Housing received 68 votes. It was put to the gathered body, and unanimously passed, that we would also continue to work on juvenile incarceration by focusing on school-based arrests. Thank you to everyone who made their voices heard by being a part of the Community Problems Assembly!
            </p>
            <p>
                Another very exciting part of the evening was that we welcomed three new member congregations/organizations! The YWCA of Charleston, St. Francis Episcopal, and Bethel Presbyterian have all joined our ranks and that growth is wonderful to see. Those in attendance also voted to install new CAJM Board Members whose terms begin January 1, 2016.

One hundred Team Leaders voted on behalf of their house meetings and Network Members and the voting results were as follows:

                What justice problems are there in the Charleston area?
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The Charleston area includes Charleston (population 665,000), Berkeley (population 178,000), and Dorchester (population 137,000) Counties.  
            </h2>
            <p>
                Using Charleston County as an example, over 16% of the population is below the poverty level, unemployment is above 9%, illiteracy is 14%, and 19% are uninsured.  Conversations among the clergy and laity have identified justice problems in education, housing, unemployment, crime, health care, addiction, incarceration policy, and others.  CAJM congregations have a strong desire to build relationships across racial, cultural, religious, and geographic barriers in order to powerfully address justice problems in the Charleston area.

                CAJM began in 2011 when a group of clergy gathered together to form a Sponsoring Committee with the Director of DART to begin the process of establishing a justice organization in the Charleston area. In October of 2012, member congregations came together and voted to address the following issues: Schools/Education and Crime/Violence. CAJM's research committees worked tirelessly to identify the specific issues for CAJM to address.
