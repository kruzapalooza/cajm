                We turned out over 1,500 people at our first annual public meeting to gain commitments from our public officials toward the use of best practices to correct systemic injustices.
                With our power of people, we gained a commitment from Dr. McGinley, Superintendent of Charleston County Public Schools to submit a proposal to the Charleston County School District Board of Trustees to provide preschool education to ALL of the county's 4 year olds in Title I schools by the year 2015, to implement a research-based literacy curriculum, and to measure the progress of those children through third grade.  We also gained commitments from our local law enforcement officials, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and Solicitor General Wilson to participate in our task force to develop a plan to reduce pretrial detention by 65% in 2014.
